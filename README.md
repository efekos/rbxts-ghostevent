This module creates an event system that is really easy to use. The main point of this event system is that none of the events have to stay in ReplicatedStorage. All the events automatically get created when fired, and gets deleted after the job is done with that event.

Most of the hackers on Roblox follow these steps to hack a game:

* Step 1 - Download an exploit that lets you see the 'Explorer' tab ingame.
* Step 2 - Find where the events are stored in ReplicatedStorage.
* Step 3 - Fire any event you want to manipulate the game.
* Step 4 - You just hacked the game!

When you use this module to make your event system, most of the hackers will fail Step 2 and 3. This makes the hackers' job a lot harder when it's about your game.
